## Stream Platform - Project
I'm working on this based on personal interest, do not expect a lot.

- This project is in beta as an unfinished product at the moment 
- There is no semantic versioning to keep track of the progress 
- There is no naming conventions, I put it how "I" feel, should be
<br>

## Future plans - 3 / 25 / 2025

1. Rewrite the backend (again) plus include mongo database for faster performance
> Create an entry in the database for non saved content in specific collection/s
2. **UPDATED**: Improve data entries on the backend

### Mongo Models
1 [Anime](./backend/models/anime.js)
2 [Video](./backend/models/video.js)
