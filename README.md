## Stream Platform - Project
I'm working on this based on personal interest, do not expect a lot.

- This project is in beta as well as an unfinished product for the moment 
- There is no semantic versioning to keep track of the current progress 
- There is no naming conventions, I put them how I feel they should be like
<br>

## Future plans

1. Add more API routes to handle instances such as anime, videos, images
2. See if I can nest documents by referring to each (ex; _Store) in mongodb


### Mongo Models
1 [Anime](./backend/src/_planned/models/anime.js)
2 [Video](./backend/src/_planned/models/video.js)
